## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), and please use HaxeFlixel 5.0.2 please.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit`  on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml


If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run `haxelib remove linc_luajit` into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.

If you want video support on your mod, simply do `haxelib install hxCodec` on a Command prompt/PowerShell.

otherwise, you can delete the "VIDEOS_ALLOWED" Line on Project.xml

To install the new DiscordRPC you need to type: `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/YoshiCrafter29/LincDiscordRPCButtons` on a Command prompt/PowerShell, or else the mod will not compile.

If you can't install the discord_rpc in that way, download this one: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uybV4nLgIFv6j5dnl1yAV8sT7dc5Dfib/view

After downloading it, go to `C:\HaxeToolkit\haxe\lib\` and extract the zip file.
